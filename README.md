# guess_the_num

It's a javascript project for beginners.
enter any random number and try to guess the number. if your entered number is high then it will say too high! enter a new number. and if it is low then it's saying too low! enter a new number.
if you reach the number then the console will say congrats, and it will also tell the number of guesses you have used.
